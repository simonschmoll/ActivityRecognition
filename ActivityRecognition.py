#Feature Extraction
#For Feature Extraction we use a technique called window overlapping (reserch paper 3). It has an overlap of 50% between the different
#time series. As a time window 1 second is use --> corresponds to 52 samplings (52 Hz frequency)
#First we transform the Dataframe into an numpy array

#Next we need to extract different arrays with the same activity


#Then we start with the sequencing
#Slicing needs to be done as follows:
#- it is not possible that 2 activities are grouped in one sequence (would falsify the outcome of the mean value)
#- therefore only labels with the same value are grouped into one sequence
